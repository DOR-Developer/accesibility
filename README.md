# Web Accessibility
## About this project
Web technologies are everywhere and they will keep expanding over the years, eventually replacing traditional ways of doing things as a whole.

Of course, I'm all for this - I'm a web developer after all - but when websites don't stand up to everyone's necessities, it bugs me.
> When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. However, currently many sites and tools are developed with accessibility barriers that make them difficult or impossible for some people to use.
Making the web accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society. International web standards define what is needed for accessibility.

[WAI - Web Accessibility Initiative]

Over 15% of the world's population has some kind of impairment; which makes poorly designed websites present an arduous experience.

The WAI docs present several examples about how these problems affect different potential users:
- A person that needs to use a wheelchair, that has a device attached to it without the possibility of rotating the screen.
- Someone who, due to a visual impairment condition, has trouble reading low contrast text.
- People with physical limiting conditions that have trouble clicking buttons, or can't move at all and need to rely on screen readers and voice recognition.

This repository aims to gather a collection of different tools and resources that will help developers create accessible websites.

_Designing websited with the 15% that needs it the most in mind will ensure the other 85% has the best possible experience as well._
